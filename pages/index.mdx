# Introduction

Welcome! This is the technical documentation for the Serenity project.

Serenity is knowledge management application offering workspaces for teams to collaborate on pages. Serenity is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that only the users can access the content.

## High level terminology

- `Document` (in the UI referred to as `Page`) is a single WYSIWYG document.
- `Folder` is a container for pages or other folders.
- `User` is a person who can log in to the application.
- `Workspace` is the entity that combines a set of folders and pages and have a set of users with access to it.

## High level sharing

The content of a workspace is shared between the users of the workspace. While there are different roles `viewer`, `commenter`, `editor` and `admin` all of them have access and can decrypt the content.

In addition to that a single document can be shared via a share link.

The architecture is prepared to also allow sharing entire folers and all it's sub-folders and documents via a share link. This though is not yet implemented and we are evaluating if it is a useful feature.

## High level architecture

While the server can not access any of the content the clients rely on the server to reliably forward the encrypted information and unencrypted meta-data to the other users. In addition to that a sever does several checks to also prevent that clients receive information that they are not allowed to see or entries from other users without authorization.

## Meta data

There is a lot of meta data associated with each entity. While we would like to reduce the amount of meta-data that the server stores, this was not in scope of the initial version of Serenity. Further research in the future in areas like zero-knowledge protocols might allow us to reduce the amount of meta-data that the server stores.

# Device

A Device always belongs to a user and is used to make sure the user can access their data from multiple devices.

## Why not have a single Device per user?

The main reason is to allow the user to invalidate a Device without invalidating their entire account. This is useful if a device e.g. a mobile phone is lost or stolen.

Other reasons:

- There is no access to Secure Element on the web and in order to allow users still access through a web-interface, a Device is created for them and stored in the browser's localstorage and has an expiration date.
- Devices also reduce the risk of a user to completely loose their data e.g. when they lose their password.

Unfortionatly this decision also comes with some downsides:

- Need to encrypt for multiple device
- Need to manage the authenticity of multiple devices

## MainDevice

The `MainDevice` is only held in memory when decrypted and never stored in any kind of local storage regardless if it is a Web, mobile or desktop client.

## Structure of a Device

A `Device` consists of a:

- Signature Key Pair
- Encryption Key Pair
- Signature of the Encryption Public Key with the Signature Private Key

The purpose of the signature is to verify that

### Signature Key Pair

For the signature key pair, we use the `Ed25519` algorithm which is generated using Libsodium's `crypto_sign_keypair()`.

### Encryption Key Pair

For the encryption key pair, we use the `X25519` algorithm which is generated using Libsodium's `crypto_box_keypair()`. The public key is then signed with the signature key pair using Libsodium's `crypto_sign_detached()`.

## Storing private keys

Ideally we would use a secure storage like the `Secure Enclave` on iOS or the `KeyStore` on Android. However, this is not possible in a web browser and therefor certain compromises had been made. We hope in the future access to Secure Element will be available in the browser. See https://globalplatform.github.io/WebApis-for-SE/doc/

### iOS and Android

The `expo-secure-store` package is used to store a `Device` using Keychain on iOS and KeyStore on Android. Both leverage a Secure Element to keep the data secure.

### Web

The browser's LocalStorage is used to store a `Device`.

When logging in through the web-interface there is checkbox to choose whether the user should be logged in for 30 days. If the user chooses to be logged in for 30 days, the `Device` is stored in `LocalStorage`.

**Note**: This is only partially implemented. Specifically the 30 day limitation is not verified anywhere yet.

### Desktop

**Note**: This is not implemented yet.

We plan to use Apple's `Keychain` on macOS and `Secret Service` on Linux and `Windows Credential Manager` on Windows.

## User Chain

In order to verify that a `Device` belongs to a certain user each user has a `user-chain`. It is a chain of events (add or remove device) each signed with the main device and the previous event from which a finite set of active device can be derived.

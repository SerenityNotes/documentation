# Device

A Device always belongs to a user and is used to make sure the user can access their data from multiple devices.

## Why not have a single Device per user?

The main reason is to allow the user to invalidate a Device without invalidating their entire account. This is useful if a device e.g. a mobile phone is lost or stolen.

Other reasons:

- There is no access to Secure Element on the web and in order to allow users still access through a web-interface, a Device is created for them and stored in the browser's localstorage and has an expiration date.
- Devices also reduce the risk of a user to completely loose their data e.g. when they lose their password.

Unfortionatly this decision also comes with some downsides:

- Need to encrypt for multiple device
- Need to manage the authenticity of multiple devices

## MainDevice

The `MainDevice` is only held in memory when decrypted and never stored in any kind of local storage regardless if it is a Web, mobile or desktop client.

## Structure of a Device

A `Device` consists of a:

- Signature Key Pair
- Encryption Key Pair
- Signature of the Encryption Public Key with the Signature Private Key

The purpose of the signature is to verify that

### Signature Key Pair

For the signature key pair, we use the `Ed25519` algorithm which is generated using Libsodium's `crypto_sign_keypair()`.

### Encryption Key Pair

For the encryption key pair, we use the `X25519` algorithm which is generated using Libsodium's `crypto_box_keypair()`. The public key is then signed with the signature key pair using Libsodium's `crypto_sign_detached()`.

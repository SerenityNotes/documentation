# Document Chain

Each document has a document-chain to determine which share devices have been created. A share device is a device that is provided to an external user to interact only with this specific document. These entries can be revoked manually, but also expire based on the expiredAt property. In addition a role must be defined to determine the permissions of the share device. The role can be one of the following:

- viewer
- commenter
- editor

Only a workspace owner or editor can create a share device.

The chain is supposed to be immutable. Items can't be reordered and no forks are allowed. In case a fork is dedected the chain is considered invalid.

The chain is a series of events where each event contains a

- transaction
  - type
  - version
  - previous event hash
  - … custom props depending on the type
- author
  - publicKey
  - signature of the combined transaction hash and the previous transaction hash

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/tree/main/packages/document-chain/src

Based on the document-chain a current state of the active share devices can be determined for each event.

## Cryptographic Dependencies and actual implementation

- sign: `sodium.crypto_sign_detached(message, privateKey)`

## Available Transaction Types

- createDocumentChain
- addDocumentShareDevice
- removeDocumentShareDevice

## Device structure

- signingPublicKey
- encryptionPublicKey
- encryptionPublicKeySignature (context prefix: `share_document_device_encryption_public_key`)

## Overview of state after a chain has been processed

- id
- devices
- removedDevices
- eventHash
- eventVersion // for protocol versioning

## Creating any chain event

```ts
transaction = {
  prevEventHash, // is null for the createChain event
  …
}
transactionHash = hash(canonicalize(transaction));
signature = sign(transactionHash, privateKey);
```

## Cryptographic validation for all chain events

```ts
transactionHash = hash(canonicalize(transaction));
signVerify(author.signature, transactionHash, author.publicKey);
```

This allows to validate:

- the transaction is authenticated by the author
- the transaction is not modified

For the createDocumentChain event the prevEventHash is null. For all other events it must be defined. Once provided it results in the following properties:

- the previousEventHash is authenticated by the author
- the previousEventHash is not modified

## Transaction Types and Validations

### Create chain

```ts
transaction = {
  type: "create",
  id: generateId(),
  prevEventHash: null,
  version,
};
```

The `id` is to identify the document by ID.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/packages/document-chain/src/createDocumentChain.ts

Validations:

- has a signingPublicKey, encryptionPublicKey and valid encryptionPublicKeySignature for the main device `signVerify(encryptionPublicKeySignature, encryptionPublicKey, signingPublicKey)`

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/packages/document-chain/src/applyCreateDocumentChainEvent.ts

### Add Document Share Device

Adds a device to the document. `signingPublicKey`, `encryptionPublicKey` and `role` are required parameters, while `expiresAt` is optional. The idea behind expiresAt is that you can add short lived devices and each client, but also the server can check that expired devices are not included in e.g. workspace key rotations.

In order to prevent drifts between clients the device session for example expires earlier than the expiredAt.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/packages/document-chain/src/addShareDocumentDevice.ts

Validations:

- the device does not exist in the state derived until the event
- has a signingPublicKey, encryptionPublicKey and valid encryptionPublicKeySignature `signVerify(encryptionPublicKeySignature, encryptionPublicKey, signingPublicKey)`

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/packages/document-chain/src/applyEvent.ts#L62-L79

Note: When invoking this function it must be verified that the author has the required permissions to add a device (`EDITOR` | `ADMIN`). This is not part of the chain validation.

#### Creating a document share link

The purpose of a document share device is to create a share link that allows external people to access the document content. Currently only read-only is implemented (while the UI allows to set a role of `editor` or `commenter`). The share link is generated here:

```ts
// create device
deviceSigningKeyPair = signingKeyPairGen();
deviceEncryptionKeyPair = encryptionKeyPairGen();
deviceEncryptionPublicKeySignature = sign(
"share_document_device_encryption_public_key" +
  deviceEncryptionKeyPair.publicKey,
deviceSigningKeyPair.privateKey
);
// encrypt device
shareLinkDeviceKey = secretboxKeygen();
nonce = noncegen();
shareLinkDeviceCiphertext = encrypt(
{
  deviceSigningKeyPair.publicKey,
  deviceSigningKeyPair.privateKey,
  deviceEncryptionKeyPair.publicKey,
  deviceEncryptionKeyPair.privateKey,
  deviceEncryptionPublicKeySignature,
},
nonce,
shareLinkDeviceKey
);
```

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/utils/document/createDocumentShareLink.ts

The encrypted device is sent to the backend when a share link is created. During this process an access token is generated by the backend. With the `token`, `documentId` and `shareLinkDeviceKey` the share link can be generated. It has the following structure: `${frontendOrigin}/page/${documentId}/${token}#key=${shareLinkDeviceKey}`.

### Remove Document Share Device

Removes a device based on the provided `signingPublicKey`

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/packages/document-chain/src/removeShareDocumentDevice.ts

Validations:

- the device does exist in the state derived until the event

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/packages/document-chain/src/applyEvent.ts#L81-L95

Note: When invoking this function it must be verified that the author has the required permissions to add a device (`EDITOR` | `ADMIN`). This is not part of the chain validation.

## Versioning

Each transaction includes a version of the protocol. Once the version has been increased by one transaction it can't go lower anymore. This means every client must have the same or a higher version than the last transaction in the chain otherwise the chain is considered invalid.

It also fails in case the version is higher than the currently known to prevent the chain being processed by an older client.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/packages/document-chain/src/applyEvent.ts#L43-L54

### Server Checks

When resolving the state on the backend also the knownVersion has to passed in. This ensures are client doesn't send a chain with a higher version than the server knows.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/backend/src/database/document/createDocument.ts#L63-L66

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/backend/src/database/document/createDocumentShareLink.ts#L80-L84

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/backend/src/database/document/removeDocumentShareLink.ts#L54-L58

## App Integration

Whenever a new document is created a new document chain is created with it: https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/pull/806/files

This PR added querying the documentChain, adding and removing share links: https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/pull/807

TODO reference the first documentChain hash in every snapshot to bind those two together

## Decrypting the shareLinkDevice

When the share link is used with someone external this person can use the share link to access to the document. The key is used to decrypt the box.

```ts
shareLinkDevice = decrypt(
  shareLinkDeviceCiphertext,
  nonce,
  senderDeviceEncryptionPublicKey,
  shareLinkDeviceKey
);
```

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/navigation/screens/sharePageScreen/sharePageScreenMachine.ts#L143-L154

Instead of having a seed for generating the key pair it was decided that a secret box should be used. This ensurese that if the link gets invalidated the shareLinkDevice can't be reconstructed from the link anymore, because the server can refuse to share the secret box. With a seed used for key generation functions reconstruction would have been possible and a leaked share link would have meant a leaked share link device that could decrypt document content.

Of couse a leaked share link that has not been revoked can be used to decrypt the shareLinkDevice. So if a share link has been used before it was revoked then an attacker would have had access to the content. This is by design. The idea of this design was to improve for revoked share links.

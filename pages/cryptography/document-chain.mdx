# Document Chain

// create a chain
// id

// add-share-device
// runs createDocumentShareLink
// returns virtualDeviceKey
// stores in the chain the
// - signingPublicKey
// - encryptionPublicKey
// - encryptionPublicKeySignature
// - expiresAt
// - role
// can only be done by someone with editor role in the workspace

// remove-share-device
// removes it from the chain

// each chain state must reference the workspace chain event to define the members
// TODO how to define the devices

// each snapshot must reference a chain state
// with a new chain event it's required to create a new snapshot

// TODO does removing a member or changing the member role from the workspace also require a new entry in the document chain?

## Password Reset

Not yet implemented.

The idea is to allow a user to create one or possibly more recovery keys in the settings. They have to be added to each workspace chain.

With the recovery key and email verification a user can take over an account and replace the MainDevice.

This would require to re-run the OPAQUE registration flow in order to create a new login process.

## Password Complexity

Currently the only requirement is that the password must be at least 6 characters long. This can result in weak passwords and opens up the possibility for admins with access to the database or an attacker gaining access to brute-force the password and extract the `exportKey` which would break the end-to-end encryption.

Therefor an open TODO is to implement a password complexity check upon registration. The strongest condenter currently is:

- https://zxcvbn-ts.github.io/zxcvbn/guide/getting-started/

It's based on on [Dropox's zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn), written in Typescript, actively maintained and used by other projects e.g. [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/security/password-protection#password-strength)

## OPAQUE

One open TODO is to hard-code the server's public key into the client codebase and verify it during the registration and login process.

## Password Reset

Not yet implemented.

The idea is to allow a user to create one or possibly more recovery keys in the settings. They have to be added to each workspace chain.

With the recovery key and email verification a user can take over an account and replace the MainDevice.

This would require to re-run the OPAQUE registration flow in order to create a new login process.

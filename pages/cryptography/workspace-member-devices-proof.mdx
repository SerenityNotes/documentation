# Workspace Member Devices Proof

## Introduction

For each workspace chain event the members in the workspace can be determined. This though doesn't include the devices of members. In order to create a cryptographic proof of all the members including their devices the `workspaceMemberDevicesProof` was created.

## Background

An alternative design would have been to have the members and devices in the workspace chain. This would have certainly simplified the design, but then the workspace chain would become a lot longer and the server would have to provide a lot more data for web clients.

The idea of this design was to have a short workspace chain and only fetch the devices information on demand when the `workspaceMemberDevicesProof` is references e.g. in a Document snapshot AAD.

## Structures

### Proof

```ts
type WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof = {
  hash: string;
  hashSignature: string;
  version: number;
  clock: number;
});
```

The `hash` is a hash of the `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProofData` and the `hashSignature` is a signature of the hash. The `hash` is used to uniquely identify entries and the `hashSignature` is used to verify the integrity of the data by a device of an existing workspace member.

The `clock` is a number that is incremented for each new `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` and is used to determine the latest `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` and also to make sure that the server can only provide newer `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` and never older ones.

The `version` is used to make sure that the client is aware of the latest `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` and if not the client must be updated.

### Content Structure

```ts
type WorkspaceMemberDevicesProofData = {
  clock: number;
  workspaceChainHash: string;
  userChainHashes: record<userId, userChainEventHash>;
};
```

The `clock` is the same as in the `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof`.

The `workspaceChainHash` is the hash of the workspace chain that should be referenced.

The `userChainHashes` is a map of user ids to the hash of the user chain event of each user. From each user-chain it's possible to determine the active and removed devices of the user.

## Utilities

There are only two functions to create and verify a `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof`.

- createWorkspaceMemberDevicesProof
- isValidWorkspaceMemberDevicesProof

## Cryptographic Dependencies and actual implementation

- hash: `sodium.to_base64(sodium.crypto_generichash(64, message))`
- canonicalize: predictable canonicalization of JSON as defined by RFC8785 https://www.npmjs.com/package/canonicalize
- sign: `sodium.crypto_sign_detached(message, privateKey)`
- signVerify: `sodium.crypto_sign_detached(signature, message, publicKey)`

### createWorkspaceMemberDevicesProof

It requires the following arguments:

- workspaceMemberDevicesProofData
- authorKeyPair

The functions returns a proof.

```ts
hash = hash(canonicalize(workspaceMemberDevicesProofData));
hashSignature = sign(
  concat("workspace_member_devices_proof", hash),
  authorKeyPair.privateKey
);
```

### isValidWorkspaceMemberDevicesProof

```ts
hash = hash(canonicalize(workspaceMemberDevicesProofData));
assert(hash === proof.hash);
signVerify(
  proof.hashSignature,
  concat("workspace_member_devices_proof", hash),
  authorKeyPair.publicKey
);
```

## Version Checks

Each Workspace Integrity Proof is associated with a version. Is the version higher than what the current client is aware of the client will throw an error and the user must be informed to update the application.

## App Integration

### Creating a proof

On every event that changes adds a workspace chain entry or changes a user chain entry the client must create a new `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` and send it along with the event to the server.

The server verifies the result and stores the `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` with the related data (workspaceChainHash and userChainHashes) in the database. The server uses one re-usable function to verify the proof: https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/backend/src/database/workspace/updateWorkspaceMemberDevicesProof.ts. Only for creating a workspace the `isValidWorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` is used directly on the server.

Here a list of all event and the affected chain:

- create workspace (workspace chain)
- update workspace member role (workspace chain)
- remove member from workspace (workspace chain)
- create workspace invitation (workspace chain)
- accept workspace invitation (workspace chain)
- delete workspace invitation (workspace chain)
- add device during login (user chain)
- delete device (user chain)
- logout (user chain - removes the current device)

### Verifying the proof

Every proof that is received by a client is verified and only then added to the local sqlite DB.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/workspaceMemberDevicesProofStore.ts#L133-L142

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/workspaceMemberDevicesProofStore.ts#L217-L229

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/workspaceMemberDevicesProofStore.ts#L300-L312

In case a proof is not valid and error is thrown and the application will crash. In the future this should be handled more gracefully by showing an error message explaining the problem.

### Storing verified proofs

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/workspaceMemberDevicesProofStore.ts

### Referencing the proof

The proof is referenced in the AAD of a document snapshot.

First the client fetches the latest `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` from the server.
https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/components/page/Page.tsx#L197-L198

Then the client creates a new document snapshot and references the `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` in the AAD.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/components/page/Page.tsx#L247

### Using the proof

When the client receives a document snapshot it will try to get the data for that proof (first locally if available and then from the remote).

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/components/page/Page.tsx#L272-L277

Based on the proof a client can determine if the document snapshot and all referenced updates and ephemeral messages are signed by a an active device by a member of the workspace at the time of the workspace chain entry.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/components/page/Page.tsx#L353-L357

#### Snapshot rotation

Whenever a new `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` is available the new document change must result in a snapshot. This is necessary since the new `WorkspaceMemberDevicesProof` might reference a new `UserChain` entry that added the current device of the user. Without referencing the new proof the client would sign the update with a device that is not referenced in the proof and therefore the update would be invalid.

# Secure Client Storage

The following information should be stored in there:

- device private keys (signing and encryption)
- sessionKey (OPAQUE)
- unencrypted content (folder names, document titles, document names)
- chain events (workspace-chains, user-chains, document-chains)

Therefor an encrypted SQLite database is used. Specifically https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher which is encrypted with one master key. The master key is stored in a secure storage supported by a Secure Element. If no such storage is available no data is stored locally.

All code related to the SQLite database integration can be found in this folder https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/tree/main/apps/app/store. Currently SQLCipher is not integrated in any environment and therefor only an in-memory database is used for local state.

## Desktop clients

For the desktop devices https://github.com/signalapp/better-sqlite3 is used. It is a SQLCipher implementation working in Electron.

To store the master key electron offers a https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/safe-storage and integrates with the macOS Keychain and Windows Credential Manager on Windows.

### iOS and Android

For the mobile devices (ReactNative) currently there is no secure implementation and we are looking into forking https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-sqlite to support SQLCipher.

The `expo-secure-store` package is used to store a `Device` using Keychain on iOS and KeyStore on Android. Both leverage a Secure Element to keep the data secure.

### Web

Since in a web client no secure storage available, it's not planned to store data locally. Possibly hashes of the chains (e.g. workspace-chain) could be stored, but this has not yet been decided.

The browser's LocalStorage is used to store a device private keys and sessionKey. This is not as secure as other storage options, but it's the only option available. To reduce the risk an expiration data is set.

## Web client

## Current state

As of today only the private keys and sessionToken are stored in the secure storage and no other data is stored locally.

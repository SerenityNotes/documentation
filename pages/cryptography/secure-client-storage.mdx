# Secure Client Storage

The following information should be stored locally if possible:

- device private keys (signing and encryption)
- sessionKey (OPAQUE)
- unencrypted content (folder names, document titles, document names)
- chain events (workspace-chains, user-chains, document-chains)

## Storage for content

### General

Sqlite was chosen as the database to store the data locally. Depending on the environment the database is only stored in-memory and/or encrypted and persisted on the local file system.

- Web: only in-memory
- Electron: in-memory and regularliy and encrypted on the local file system
- iOS and Android: every change is directly encrypted and persisted on the local file system using sqlcipher

All code related to the SQLite database integration can be found in this folder https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/tree/main/apps/app/store.

The following data is currently stored in there:

- user https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/userStore.ts#L14-L25
- currentUserInfo https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/currentUserInfoStore.ts
- userChain https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/userChainStore.ts
- workspace (only id & name) https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/workspaceStore.ts#L20-L21
- workspaceChain https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/workspaceChainStore.ts
- workspaceMemberDevicesProof https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/workspaceMemberDevicesProofStore.ts
- documentChain https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/documentChainStore.ts
- document content https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/documentStore.ts
- app state https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/appStateStore.ts (lastOpenWorkspaceId for a better UX to open the last open workspace on app start)

The benefit of using a local sqlite DB as state management is, that it the same way in all environments and only need to switch the storage implementation. This simplify the application logic and ideally reduces bugs.

And since chain and workspaceMemberDevicesProof entries are never overwritten by new data coming from the server, the server is discourage to send broken entries since a client either can persist then or could be long-living if users keep their browser tabs open.

### Web

For the web client the in-memory Sqlite DB is used. The database is created on app start and deleted on logout.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sql/sql.web.ts#L6-L21 (open DB)

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sql/sql.web.ts#L23-L26 (reset DB on logout)

### Electron

For the Electron client the in-memory Sqlite DB is used.

The in-memory Sqlite db is regularliy exported (currently debounces on every document write), encrypted and stored on the local file system. The key and nonce to encrypt the database is encrypted using https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/safe-storage which is also stored on the local file system.

```ts
key = sodium.randombytes_buf(sodium.crypto_secretbox_KEYBYTES);
nonce = sodium.randombytes_buf(sodium.crypto_secretbox_NONCEBYTES);
encryptedKeyAndNonce = electron.safeStorage.encryptString(serialize(key, nonce));
encryptedDatabase = sodium.crypto_secretbox_easy(database, nonce, key);
```

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sql/sql.electron.ts#L29-L39

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/desktop-app/src/index.ts#L114-L157

When the application is started the encrypted database is loaded and decrypted using the key and nonce. The decrypted database is then used as the in-memory database.

```ts
decryptedDataString = electron.safeStorage.decryptString(encryptedKeyAndNonce);
decryptedData = deserialize(decryptedDataString);
decryptedDatabase = sodium.crypto_secretbox_open_easy(data, nonce, key);
```

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sql/sql.electron.ts#L9-L23

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/desktop-app/src/index.ts#L159-L185

On logout the database, key-and-nonce file is deleted.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/navigation/screens/logoutInProgressScreen/LogoutInProgressScreen.tsx#L139

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sql/sql.electron.ts#L40C1-L42

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/desktop-app/src/index.ts#L187-L197

#### Considerations for alternative designs

An alternative design could be to use https://github.com/signalapp/better-sqlite3. It is a SQLCipher implementation working in Electron. The API is async and won't work for a good UX. Therefor we would need to manage the writes between the in-memory and the persisted DB. This includes managing failed writes and possible recovery. This is out of scope for now, but we will consider it in the future.

### Mobile

For the mobile devices (ReactNative) no in-memory Sqlite database is used, but instead a React Native wrapper library https://github.com/OP-Engineering/op-sqlcipher to directly use https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher to persist data encrypted on the device.

Sqlcipher requires and encryption key. The key is generated every time and no key is stored in the secure store of the device. The key is generated using `sodium.randombytes_buf(sodium.crypto_secretbox_KEYBYTES)`.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sql/sql.ts#L15-L21

When the user logs out a the database is deleted and the key in the secure store is deleted. Right after that the `ready` function runs again and creates a new database and key.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sql/sql.ts#L35-L40

### Database reset on logout

On logout the local in-memory DB must be wiped. For the in-memory DB it is fine to just reconnect and the new instance will be empty.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/navigation/screens/logoutInProgressScreen/LogoutInProgressScreen.tsx#L159

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sql/sql.web.ts#L23-L26

## Storage for device and session keys

### Environments

#### iOS and Android

The `expo-secure-store` package is used to store a `Device` using Keychain on iOS and KeyStore on Android. Both leverage a Secure Element to keep the data secure.

Code reference: https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/deviceStore/deviceStore.ts

Also for the sessionKey the `expo-secure-store` package is used to store the sessionKey in the Keychain on iOS and KeyStore on Android.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sessionKeyStore/sessionKeyStore.ts

#### Desktop clients

To store the device with it's private keys we use Electron's https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/safe-storage. It integrates with the macOS Keychain and Windows Credential Manager on Windows.

Here the `safeStorage.encryptString` and `safeStorage.decryptString` is used to encrypt/decrypt a string with the serialized device. The encrypted string is stored on the local file system.

Encryption:

```ts
serializedDevice = JSON.stringify(device);
const encryptedDevice = await safeStorage.encryptString(serializedDevice);
```

Decryption:

```ts
const serializedDevice = await safeStorage.decryptString(encryptedDevice);
const device = JSON.parse(serializedDevice);
```

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/deviceStore/deviceStore.electron.ts

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/utils/setupElectronInterface/electronInterface.electron.ts#L22-L34

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/desktop-app/src/index.ts#L17

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/desktop-app/src/index.ts#L235-L265

The session key is stored in the same way as the device.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sessionKeyStore/sessionKeyStore.ts

#### Web client

Since in a web client no secure storage available and therefor no content is persistet on the client. Possibly hashes of the chains (e.g. workspace-chain) could be stored, but this is not implemented and no decision in favor of it has been made.

Also device private keys are not stored locally. The only data that is stored locally is the sessionKey, webDeviceAccessToken and a webDeviceKey. The webDeviceKey is used to encrypt the web device (incl. private signing and encryption key) and stored on the server when adding the device to the account.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/utils/authentication/loginHelper.ts#L106-L122

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/webDeviceStore.ts#L17-L20

When a user open the application the webDeviceAccessToken is used to fetch the encrypted device and decrypt it with the webDeviceKey. The decrypted device is then stored only in memory and will be gone after closing the browser tab.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/hooks/useCachedResources.ts (invoked on app start)

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/utils/device/getActiveDevice.ts#L10

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/webDeviceStore.ts#L26-L50

This design was chosen to ensure that a revoked or expired web device can't be extracted from a compromised browser since the server rejects returning the device ciphertext and nonce.
The design that was rejected was to store the device private keys directly in the browser's LocalStorage. This would have been possible, but would have meant that a compromised browser could have extracted the device private keys.

Code reference for the webDeviceStore: https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/webDeviceStore.ts

The session key in comparision is directly stored in localstorage using the `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` package: https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/store/sessionKeyStore/sessionKeyStore.ts

### Deleting keys on logout

On logout the device and session keys must be deleted. This is done by calling the `clearDeviceAndSessionStorage` function.

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/navigation/screens/logoutInProgressScreen/LogoutInProgressScreen.tsx#L140

https://github.com/serenity-kit/Serenity/blob/main/apps/app/utils/authentication/clearDeviceAndSessionStores.ts

## User and Device Logout

## Cryptographic Dependencies and actual implementation

- removeDevice: see user-chain

## Logout

Logout is done on a route, but has to be triggered manually with a click that sets the `logoutInitiated` variable to true. Just visiting the route will not trigger the logout.

Once the logout runs a `removeDevice` chain event is created on the user-chain. In addition all device and session storages are cleared.

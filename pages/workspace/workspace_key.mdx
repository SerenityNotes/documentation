# Workspace Key

Each workspace has one active workspace key which is shared between all current members of a workspace.

The workspace key serves two purposes:

- key to encrypt and decrypt workspace related data e.g. workspace name
- master key to derive sub-keys for encryption of folders and documents using a kdf

**Note**: The workspace name yet is not encrypted.

## Workspace key sharing

The workspace key is shared via lockboxes for the devices of all workspace members.

## Workspace key rotation

Whenever a member or a device of a member is removed the workspace key is being rotated. This means lockboxes for all devices of all workspace members have to be created.

TODO identify if this also should happend for expired web devices, most likely yes

TODO add code reference for creating a workspace key and the lockboxes

TODO possible improvement: encrypt all past workspace keys with the new key so all the past lockboxes don't have to be fetched anymore (except for a malicious user actor)

## Folder and document key derivation

For key derivation Libsodium's `crypto_kdf_derive_from_key` is used.

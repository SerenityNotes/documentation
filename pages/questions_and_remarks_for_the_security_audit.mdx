## React-Native-Libsodium

- Is the `memcpy` appraoch fine?

## HTTPS connections

- Are there any HTTP security feautes we should activate? (e.g. HSTS)

## Websocket Connections

- Is the `sessionKey` authentication as a query parameter secure enough or what are proposed alternatives?
- Should the `Origin` header be verified to basically simuate CORS checking? Does it provide any additional security in this case?
- Should the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header be verified to basically simulate CORS checking? Does it provide any additional security in this case?
- Is the `webSocketServer` setup fine or should we restrict `maxPayload` for example?
- Is `webSocketServer.handleUpgrade` handled correctly?
